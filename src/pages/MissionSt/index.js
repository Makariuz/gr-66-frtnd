                Welcome to my blog gospel road! A blog inspired through a conversation with a 
                sceptical friend who

                I told him that I will follow God and take the gospel road... 
                Route 66 standing for the 66 books of the bible. 

                I welcome you in Jesus name and pray that the writing inspired by the spirit 
                of God will encourage and edify you!
